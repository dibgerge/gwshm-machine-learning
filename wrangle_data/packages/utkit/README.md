# utkit

UTkit is used for performing signal processing on time series signals generally, which for example are encountered in Ultrasonics. The library extends the popular library pandas to support functions commonly used in UT analysis. The module utkit implements three classes:

* Signal3D: representation of a 2-D collection of time series (raster scan).

* Signal2D: representation of a 1-D collection of time series (single line scan).

* Signal: representation of a time series.
